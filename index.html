        <p>Hi! My name is Jean Paul. I am currently a student at Florida Gulf Coast University studying towards a bachelor in software engineering with a possible minor in mathematics. Some of the courses that I am currently taking includes physics, calculus and intro to programming. After graduating, I hope to pursue a career in either cybersecurity or software development. Further below you can find some of my profiles on Github and Codecademy where I like to learn and practice my skills in coding. Other than my academic experience, I was born Puerto Rico and currently live in Cape Coral with my family and my beloved dog Murphy. In my free time I enjoy reading comics, watching movies, working out at the gym, and playing video games with my friends. Some of my favorite shows are <em>The Daily Show, The Office, and Daredevil</em>. I love to travel, and some of my favorite experiences are my trips to Costa Rica and Chile. </p>
